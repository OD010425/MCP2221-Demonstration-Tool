# MCP2221 Demonstration Tool
A demonstration tool for the MCP2221 USB to UART/I2C bridge peripherals. This tool is developed in C++ using Qt framework and MCP2221 DLL v2 from Microchip Technologies.
In this tool you can:
- Configure the GPIO pins (GP0 to GP3) as input, output, analog input, or analog output.
- Plot data captured from analog input pins.
- Send and receive data from the UART.
- Scan the I2C bus to display any connected devices. Make sure the pull-up resistors are connected to the SDA and SCL pins.
  
**Minimum requirements:**
  - Qt framework v6 or higher.
  - MCP2221 DLL v2 from Microchip Technologies.
